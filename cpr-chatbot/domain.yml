responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hello! I'm your CPR assistant. I can help you learn about CPR, cardiac arrest, and emergency procedures. How can I help you today?"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Goodbye! Remember, knowing CPR can save lives. Stay safe!"

  utter_thank_you:
  - text: "You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help you learn about life-saving techniques."

  utter_what_can_do:
  - text: "I can help you with:\n• Understanding cardiac arrest\n• Learning CPR techniques\n• Emergency procedures\n• Using a defibrillator\n• Recognizing symptoms\n• Emergency contact numbers"

  utter_cardiac_arrest_info:
  - text: "Cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops beating effectively. This cuts off blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. Without immediate treatment, it can be fatal within minutes. Brain damage can begin after just 4-6 minutes without oxygen."

  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "Signs of cardiac arrest include:\n• Person suddenly collapses\n• No response to shouting or shaking\n• No normal breathing or gasping\n• No pulse (if you know how to check)\n• Skin turns blue or gray\n\nIf you see these signs, call emergency services immediately and start CPR!"

  utter_how_to_react:
  - text: "If someone has cardiac arrest:\n1. Check if they're responsive\n2. Call emergency services (911/112) immediately\n3. Start CPR right away\n4. Use an AED if available\n5. Continue until help arrives\n\nRemember: Fast action saves lives!"

  utter_emergency_numbers:
  - text: "Emergency numbers:\n• USA/Canada: 911\n• Europe: 112\n• UK: 999\n• Australia: 000\n\nAlways call emergency services first before starting CPR. If others are present, have someone else call while you start CPR."

  utter_what_is_cpr:
  - text: "CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions and rescue breaths to keep blood and oxygen flowing when someone's heart has stopped. It can double or triple survival chances when performed immediately."

  utter_cpr_steps:
  - text: "CPR Steps:\n1. Place person on firm surface\n2. Kneel beside their chest\n3. Place heel of hand on center of chest\n4. Place other hand on top, interlace fingers\n5. Push hard and fast at least 2 inches deep\n6. Let chest recoil completely\n7. Push at 100-120 compressions per minute\n8. Give 30 compressions, then 2 rescue breaths\n9. Continue until help arrives"

  utter_mouth_to_mouth:
  - text: "Rescue Breathing (if trained):\n1. Tilt head back, lift chin\n2. Pinch nose closed\n3. Cover their mouth with your mouth\n4. Give 2 breaths, each 1 second long\n5. Watch for chest to rise with each breath\n6. Return to chest compressions\n\nNote: Hands-only CPR is also effective if you're not trained in rescue breathing."

  utter_what_is_defibrillator:
  - text: "An AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a device that can restart a heart in cardiac arrest by delivering an electric shock. Modern AEDs are designed to be used by anyone - they give voice instructions and only shock when needed."

  utter_how_to_defibrillator:
  - text: "Using an AED:\n1. Turn on the AED (follow voice prompts)\n2. Remove clothing from chest\n3. Attach pads as shown in pictures\n4. Make sure no one is touching the person\n5. Press analyze button if needed\n6. If shock advised, press shock button\n7. Immediately resume CPR\n8. Follow AED prompts until help arrives"

  utter_cpr_benefits:
  - text: "Benefits of CPR:\n• Can double or triple survival chances\n• Keeps blood flowing to brain and organs\n• Prevents brain damage\n• Buys time until professional help arrives\n• Every minute without CPR decreases survival by 7-10%\n\nLearning CPR means you could save a life!"
